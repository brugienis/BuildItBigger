# BuildItBigger

In this project, you will use Gradle to build a joke-telling app, factoring functionality into libraries and flavors to keep the build simple. You'll also configure a Google Cloud Endpoints development server to supply the jokes.

To build this project, use the "gradlew build" command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.
